## Install (Beta)

If you are a beta tester this is the method for you to install the app. In order to participate you need to check your work email and look for the testing invite that has been sent to you. It will have the subject “TestFlight”.



![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1rGn4tkPNW0qZz3dsjJcCk0ojcXzf6Cc5 "untitled")


Open the email and tap the big blue button saying “View in TestFlight”.



![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1k58cFlWaEWtiVWCFh9fstLkY_EgKWGWg "untitled")

You will be brought to this page and you need to touch “TestFlight from the App Store”. It is a good idea to record the testing code so that you can use it later.




![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1EmIyeQMaDXr7aDgFuxz23_36KSWHiUOd "untitled")

When you select “TestFlight from the App Store” you will be brought to this page in the app store (note if you got the email on your computer you can just search for this app and install it on your device). Hit the download button (The one just above “AGE” that looks like a cloud with a down arrow through it).



![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tBT0jBzv-Blosg7Ov3SEPywMEtpnVKEO "untitled")

When the download is finished open the App from the same page and you will be brought to this page. Set “Allow” for notifications and the “Continue”.



![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1gQxBZfnm5cJZNFBjpCxOEIamFu0I9qZ7 "untitled")

You will be prompted for the code that was displayed on the web browser after opening the email (reopen and tap the button if you can’t find it) and you will be brought to this page. Hit the install button and then the open button to open the app for testing.

## Setup

When the application is first opened you will need to provide a server address in order to use the application

![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZhAh-gz1CjnTzzP6GGQ-er7JyOKPtuha "untitled")

This address will be provided to you by your company - but should appear in the following format: sign365.mycompany.com

![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1QiP0ySzQGp10IpN96J1XD2k1HAAXzj_l "untitled")

If the server you have been given doesn't work you will need to contact support

### Sign In

You will now be prompted for entry of your company provided username and password. If you do not have this you should contact the administrators of the application within your company and ask them to create an account for you.

![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1OqCkBfXDl6ctEgj4PrJxUnQla7FMf6jh "untitled")

Providing your login details are correct you will be brought to the below page. This is known as the **Draft Area** and is where you will be doing the majority of your work.

## Terminology

### New Form Area

The **New Form Area** is the area where you can select the **Template** that you need to create a new form in the **Draft Area**

### Template

A **Template** is a form that is chosen in the **New Form Area**. It is an empty or prefilled form that when chosen will produce a **Draft** in the **Draft area**

### Draft

A **Draft** is a direct copy of a **Template** and will appear in the **Draft Area** it is an editable form that is filled out in preparation for submission once it is completed

### Submission

A **Submission** is a Form that has been submitted and placed into the **Submission Area**. Uploaded submissions will be denoted by a blue cloud icon in the top right hand corner

### Draft Area

The **Draft Area** is where drafts are placed after being copied from their respective templates. It is the first area that the application loads into on signin

### Submission Area

The **Submission Area** is where **Submissions** are placed after being completed and submitted by the user

### Tag

Integration Tags are labels that attach to forms to  identify the information against a a specific system that the Sign365  system interacts with. They can be thought of in a similar way to sticky notes. In that you put a sticky note on a piece of paper that  identifies it and categorizes it for future reference.

A form can have many tags, with many integrations. Each tag contains the following information

- Identifying Field
- Value Field

A user will place tags on a **Draft** as part of the process of preparing them for submission

### Context Menu

The context menu is a menu that appears on either **Drafts** or **Submissions** when you long press for 3 seconds. It offers many different options that may be performed on the forms.

## Draft

Drafts are the bread and butter of Sign365. When you first sign into Sign365 you will be brought to the **Draft Area** 

### New Draft (New Form)

Below are the steps to create a new draft:

- Go to the top right hand corner of the screen and tap the "New Form" button. This will bring up a selection of templates. 


![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1754Dq2WNP0zBaMvInYw9metAV0Q0eSfK "untitled")

- You will now see the **Draft** appear in the **Draft Area** (See Below).

### Tags (Add Tags / Clear Tags)

Now that we have a new form in the **Draft Area** we can tag the relevant data to the form by long pressing the form we want for 3 seconds  to bring up a **Context Menu** and then selecting **Add Tags** from that menu
![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WmuK7LI9EMmHRbD-H9FQgD0ULTXIFO7c "untitled")

This will give us a selection of integrations to choose from. Choose the one that applies to you. In this case we only have CHIP available to us so this is what we will use. When we are finished we tap next in the bottom right
![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1JZoC9LuhtS0FkU5hdc-gFtov5fs-VIW2 "untitled")
Now we need to select our data that we want to tag on the form. We can do this by tapping any of the names in the list. When we are finished we tap done in the bottom right
![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1y5av4cAlnyVXKZPOgBWxx9dZ0slMvt1P "untitled")

We can now see that the people we have selected are appearing as a pin in the top left corner with the number denoting the amount of tags that we have applied to a form

### Submit Form (Submit)

You can submit a form from the **Context Menu** by going to **Draft Area** > long pressing the form we want for 3 seconds > Selecting **Submit**.

This will move a form into the **Submission Area** 

The reason you want to do this is because this is how the form will be processed within your company. It will do 1 of 3 things

- Go to an administrator for approval in your company
- Go directly to an integrated system if it is tagged
- Go to an intermediate location to be sorted by an administrator in your company

## Submission

Submissions are completed forms that have moved from the **Draft Area** to the **Submission Area**. The below image shows an unuploaded form in the **Submission Area**. We know it is unuploaded because it does not have a cloud icon in the top right of the form.

![Alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZkzgSXY1Vnfwi366PQQ1WKVRVuSpjeuA "untitled")

If the form is not uploaded it may take a few seconds for it to upload. You will know that it is uploaded when the icon appears (see below image)

## Appendix A.

### Identifying Form Problems vs. App Problems

If we look at the below form we can see there are some major problems with the formatting of the form. 

1. Entered text doesn't appear to allign with the provided boxes 
2. Signatures are stretched accross the boxes
3. The forms have random capitalizations for the headings

All of the above problems are to do with the way the forms are built. They are not to do with the application. Application problems might look like crashes or problems with the functioning of application level components outside of the forms. These could be (not an exhaustive list):

1. Crashes
2. Loading issues with Tag Data
3. Submissions not being received

If you are unsure whether your issue is app related or form related it is best to contact the administrator of the application in your organization.
